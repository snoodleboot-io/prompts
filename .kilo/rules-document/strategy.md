# document-strategy.md
# Behavior when the user asks to generate or update documentation.
#
# Goal: docs that are accurate, minimal, and stay in sync with the code.
# The enemy is documentation that lies — outdated, redundant, or decorative.

## Before Writing Anything

Read the code first. Do not write docs from assumptions.
If the code and existing docs conflict, flag it — do not silently pick one.

## Inline Comments

Rule: comment the WHY, never the WHAT.
If the comment restates what the code says, delete it.

Classify every existing comment before touching it:
- GOOD: explains a non-obvious decision, invariant, or gotcha — keep
- NOISE: describes what the code already shows — delete
- OUTDATED: no longer matches the current code — rewrite or delete
- MISSING: complex logic with no explanation — add one

Good comment patterns:
  // Retry up to 3 times — the upstream API is flaky under load
  // intentionally not awaited — caller does not need confirmation
  // 86400 = seconds in a day
  // TODO: this will break if called concurrently — not yet thread-safe

## Docstrings / JSDoc / Type Annotations

For every public function, method, or class, document:
1. Purpose — one sentence: what it does, not how
2. Parameters — name, type, required/optional, valid range or constraints
3. Return value — type, shape, and what null/undefined means if applicable
4. Errors — what throws or rejects, and under what conditions
5. Side effects — DB writes, external calls, state mutations, events emitted
6. Example — one realistic call with realistic inputs and expected output

Do not document private helpers unless they contain non-obvious logic.
Use the docstring format specified in core-conventions.md.

## README Files

A README must answer four questions a new contributor would ask:

1. What does this do? (one paragraph, no jargon)
2. How do I run it locally? (exact commands, not prose)
3. How do I run the tests?
4. How is the code organized? (one sentence per top-level directory)

Also include: environment variable reference, deployment notes if relevant,
and a link to the decision log / ADRs if they exist.

Do not include: aspirational features, marketing copy, or information
that belongs in code comments.

When updating an existing README:
- Read the current version fully before editing
- Update only what has changed — do not rewrite sections that are accurate
- Flag sections that appear outdated and ask before removing them

## OpenAPI / API Documentation

Format: OpenAPI 3.0 YAML unless the project specifies otherwise.

For each endpoint include:
- operationId (verb + resource, camelCase: listUsers, createOrder)
- Summary: one line
- Request body schema with all fields typed and required fields marked
- Response schemas for: 200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500
- Tags grouped by resource
- Auth scheme (ask if not specified in core-conventions.md)

## Changelog Entries

Format: Keep a Changelog (keepachangelog.com)
Sections: Added | Changed | Deprecated | Removed | Fixed | Security

Rules:
- Write from the perspective of a consumer, not the implementer
- Do not include internal refactors unless they change observable behavior
- Prefix breaking changes: **BREAKING:**
- Ask for version number and release date if not provided
