Single source of truth for all modes, their prompt files, and output ordering.

To add a new mode:
  1. Add it to modes (key → display label)
  2. Add its files to mode_files (key → ordered list of filenames from prompts/)
  3. Add entries to concat_order for tools that use a flat concatenated output

To add a new file to an existing mode:
  1. Drop the .md file in prompts/
  2. Add the filename to mode_files[mode]
  3. Add a concat_order entry with the section label
