# coding-enforcement.md
# Behavior when the user asks to enforce coding standards or check compliance against established conventions.
#
# Purpose: Find where code has diverged from established coding standards and report violations.
# This mode is distinct from general code review — it specifically enforces documented conventions.

## Step 1 — Locate Coding Standards

Before scanning code, identify the relevant coding conventions:

1. Look for convention files in the project:
   - `core-conventions.md` — language-agnostic conventions
   - `core-conventions-{lang}.md` — language-specific conventions (e.g., `core-conventions-py.md`)
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines
   - `.editorconfig` — editor settings
   - Linter configs (`.eslintrc`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)

2. If no conventions are documented:
   - Report this as a finding
   - Ask if you should create a conventions document first
   - Do not proceed with enforcement without documented standards

## Step 2 — Scan Methodology

Scan code systematically against each convention rule:

1. **Structural conventions**: File organization, naming patterns, module boundaries
2. **Code style conventions**: Formatting, imports, naming (functions, classes, variables)
3. **Pattern conventions**: Error handling, async patterns, type hints, null handling
4. **Testing conventions**: Coverage targets, test structure, mocking rules
5. **Documentation conventions**: Docstrings, comments, README requirements

For each file reviewed, check against every applicable convention rule.

## Step 3 — Reporting Violations

For each violation found, report:

```
Rule Violated: [specific rule name from conventions]
Severity: MUST_FIX / SHOULD_FIX / CONSIDER
Location: filename:line_number or function/class name
Current Code: [brief excerpt]
Violation: [description of how it breaks the convention]
Suggested Fix: [concrete code that complies with the convention]
Rationale: [why this rule exists — from conventions doc if available]
```

### Severity Definitions

- **MUST_FIX**: The code violates a mandatory convention (e.g., security-related, type safety, architectural boundary)
- **SHOULD_FIX**: The code violates a strong convention that impacts maintainability
- **CONSIDER**: The code violates a guideline or represents a minor deviation

## Step 4 — Categories of Enforcement

### Language-Specific Rules

If `core-conventions-{lang}.md` exists, strictly enforce:
- Type hint requirements
- Import ordering rules
- Error handling patterns
- Naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase per language)
- Forbidden patterns (e.g., `setattr`/`getattr` in Python)

### Project-Wide Rules

From `core-conventions.md`:
- No hardcoded secrets or environment-specific values
- No TODOs without issue references
- Consistent error handling across the codebase
- Required file headers or license notices

### Testing Rules

- Required coverage thresholds
- Test file naming conventions
- Forbidden test patterns (e.g., tests that depend on order)

## Step 5 — Summary Report

End with a compliance summary:

```
Convention Compliance Report
============================
Files Scanned: N
Total Violations: N (MUST_FIX: X, SHOULD_FIX: Y, CONSIDER: Z)

Compliance Rate: X% (optional calculated metric)

Most Common Violations:
1. [violation type] — N occurrences
2. [violation type] — N occurrences

Priority Actions (MUST_FIX items):
1. [file:line] — [brief description]
2. [file:line] — [brief description]

Status: COMPLIANT / NEEDS_WORK / NON_COMPLIANT
```

## Special Cases

### Legacy Code
When scanning legacy code:
- Flag violations but note if the file is marked as legacy/exempt
- Suggest creating a modernization plan rather than immediate fixes

### Third-Party Code
- Exclude vendored dependencies from enforcement
- Only report if the project's conventions are violated in integration points

### Disputed Conventions
If you find a convention that appears to be outdated or consistently violated intentionally:
- Report it as a meta-finding
- Suggest updating the convention document to match reality
