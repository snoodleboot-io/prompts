# Behavior when the user asks to upgrade a dependency or package.

When the user asks to upgrade a dependency, apply a security patch, or
audit outdated packages:

## Standard Upgrade

1. Impact assessment first — before touching anything:
   - Read the changelog or release notes between the two versions
   - List every breaking change that affects this codebase
   - Search the codebase for all usages of affected APIs
   - Classify each: auto-fixable | needs manual change | needs behavior review
   - Estimate effort and risk level
   - Wait for confirmation

2. After confirmation, update each affected file one at a time.
   For mechanical changes, make them directly.
   For judgment calls, show old and new and ask which to use.

3. After all changes, produce a verification checklist:
   - Tests most likely to catch regressions
   - Behavior changes that tests won't catch automatically
   - New tests to add for the upgraded behavior

## Security Patch

When urgency is indicated or a CVE is mentioned:
1. Confirm the vulnerability affects the actual usage pattern in this codebase
2. Check if upgrading is safe (no breaking changes) or if a workaround is needed first
3. Make the version bump
4. Flag any code changes needed to adopt the security fix
5. Check if any other packages depend on this one and also need updating

## Dependency Audit

When asked to audit all dependencies:
- Run the appropriate audit/outdated command for the package manager
- Group results: security vulnerability | major update | minor/patch
- For security issues: flag severity and whether the vulnerable code path is reachable
- Recommend a prioritized upgrade order
