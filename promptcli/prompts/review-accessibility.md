# Behavior when the user asks to review UI code for accessibility, or API for usability.

## UI Accessibility Review

When the user asks to review UI code for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA standard):

Check for:
1. SEMANTIC HTML — correct elements used (button vs div, nav, main, h1-h6 hierarchy)
2. KEYBOARD NAVIGATION — all interactive elements reachable and activatable by keyboard
3. FOCUS MANAGEMENT — focus trapped in modals, restored after dialogs close
4. ARIA — roles, labels, descriptions present and correct; no redundant ARIA
5. COLOR CONTRAST — flag text or UI elements likely to fail 4.5:1 ratio
6. IMAGES — meaningful images have descriptive alt text; decorative images have alt=""
7. FORMS — all inputs labeled; errors associated with the correct field
8. MOTION — animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
9. SCREEN READER ANNOUNCEMENTS — dynamic updates announced via live regions

For each issue:
- Element or component location
- Which WCAG criterion it violates
- Suggested fix with code example

## API Usability Review

When the user asks to review an API or SDK for usability:

Check for:
1. NAMING CLARITY — endpoints, parameters, and fields named intuitively
2. CONSISTENCY — similar operations follow the same pattern
3. ERROR RESPONSES — descriptive errors with error code and human message
4. VERSIONING — breaking changes can be made safely
5. INPUT VALIDATION — inputs validated before processing, limits documented
6. RESPONSE SHAPE — consistent envelope, nullable fields marked
7. BREAKING CHANGES — would any of these changes break existing callers?
8. DOCUMENTATION GAPS — what is unclear that a consumer would need to know?
