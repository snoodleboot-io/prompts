## General Testing Principles (Language/Tooling Agnostic)

### Test Organization

Create a test directory structure that mirrors the source:
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
├── integration/    # Multi-component tests
├── slow/          # Long-running tests
└── security/      # Security-focused tests
```

Within each category, mirror source layout:
- `tests/unit/{module}/test_{file}.py`

### Unit Tests

Cover:
1. Happy path — expected inputs produce expected outputs
2. Edge cases — empty, zero, null/undefined, boundary values
3. Error cases — invalid inputs, failures, exceptions
4. State interactions — side effects

Rules:
- Descriptive test names explaining what is tested
- Minimize mocking — only use for DB, external APIs, other external dependencies
- Prefer dependency injection or real implementations over patching
- Assert on behavior, not implementation details

### Integration Tests

- Use real implementations where possible
- Mock only external third-party services
- Include proper setup/teardown
- Assert on results AND side effects

### Edge Cases

When asked for edge case inputs, cover:
1. Boundary values — min, max, exactly at limit
2. Empty / null / zero / false
3. Type mismatches
4. Oversized inputs
5. Special characters
6. Injection attempts
7. Missing required fields
8. Logical contradictions

### Specialized Testing Approaches

When appropriate for the project, consider:

1. **Property-based testing** - for functions with mathematical properties (commutativity, associativity, idempotence). Generate random inputs and verify properties hold.

2. **Snapshot testing** - for generated outputs that shouldn't change. Store expected output and compare new runs against stored snapshots.

3. **Performance testing** - timing checks for known performance characteristics. Assert execution stays within expected bounds.

4. **Fuzz testing** - random input generation for robustness. Especially useful for parsers, validators, and input handling.

5. **Contract testing** - for API/service contracts between components. Verify interfaces between services match agreed specifications.

## Python-Specific Testing

When working with Python projects:

### Framework
- Use `unittest.TestCase` for test classes
- Use `pytest` as the test runner

### Organization
- Add markers in `conftest.py`:
  - `@pytest.mark.unit`
  - `@pytest.mark.integration`
  - `@pytest.mark.slow`
  - `@pytest.mark.security`
- Auto-apply markers based on test directory

### Running Tests
```bash
# Full suite with coverage
pytest --cov={src} --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# By marker
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
```

### Coverage Targets

Aim for meaningful coverage rather than 100%:
- **Core business logic**: 80%+ coverage
- **Library code**: 70%+ coverage
- **CLI entry points**: 100% coverage (every branch/path)
- **Generated code**: Lower priority — focus on the generator, not outputs

Run coverage reports and look for uncovered lines — add tests for:
1. Error paths (exception handling)
2. Edge cases not yet covered
3. Any `if` branches not exercised
