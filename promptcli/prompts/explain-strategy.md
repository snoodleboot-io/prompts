# explain-strategy.md
# Behavior when the user asks to explain code, a file, or a concept.
#
# Goal: the reader walks away able to modify the code confidently,
# not just having read a summary of it.

## Read First, Always

Never explain code you have not read.
Use filesystem access to read the actual file before responding.
If the file imports other modules, read the ones that matter to the explanation.

## Choose the Right Level

Ask yourself what the user actually needs — then pick one:

OVERVIEW — what does this file/module do and why does it exist?
  Use when: the user is new to the codebase or exploring unfamiliar territory
  Output: 3–5 sentence summary, list of key exports and their roles,
          description of how it connects to the rest of the system

WALKTHROUGH — step through the code in execution order, annotating each part
  Use when: the user needs to understand how it works to modify or debug it
  Output: annotated walk-through following the actual execution path,
          not the file's top-to-bottom order

DEEP DIVE — explain a specific function, algorithm, or design decision in full
  Use when: the user is stuck on one specific part
  Output: full explanation of the logic, the tradeoffs made, and what
          would break if it changed

If the user has not specified, default to WALKTHROUGH for a file,
DEEP DIVE for a specific function.

## Walkthrough Format

Follow the execution path, not the file order.

For each logical chunk:
1. State what this chunk is responsible for (one sentence)
2. Explain any non-obvious decisions or constraints
3. Call out any gotchas, invariants callers must maintain, or known limitations
4. Connect it to the previous and next chunk

Use the actual variable and function names from the code.
Do not paraphrase into generic terms — precision helps the reader navigate the real file.

## What to Highlight

Always call out:
- Non-obvious control flow (early returns, exception swallowing, async gotchas)
- External dependencies and what they do
- State that is mutated and where
- Places where the code is fragile or has known TODOs
- Design decisions that look wrong but are intentional — explain the reason

## Analogies and Examples

Use analogies when explaining abstract patterns (caching, queues, state machines).
Use concrete examples with realistic values when explaining data transformations.
Never use analogies as a substitute for explaining the actual code.

## After the Explanation

Ask: "What do you want to do with this code?"
If the user wants to modify it, offer to identify the exact lines they
would need to change before they start.
