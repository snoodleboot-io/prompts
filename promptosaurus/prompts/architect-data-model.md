# Behavior when the user asks to design a data model or schema.

When the user asks to design a data model, schema, or database structure:

1. Ask these questions before producing anything:
   - What are the core entities and their relationships?
   - What are the most common read patterns?
   - What are the most common write patterns?
   - Are there soft-delete, audit trail, or versioning requirements?
   - Any known scale constraints (rows, request volume, geography)?

2. After answers are collected, produce:
   - Entity definitions: name, fields, types, nullability, defaults, constraints
   - Relationship diagram in Mermaid ERD format
   - Index recommendations based on the stated query patterns
   - Denormalization or caching recommendations with rationale
   - Migration file skeleton (up + down)
   - Open questions or tradeoffs that need a decision before implementing

3. Do NOT generate ORM code — schema design only until the user approves.

4. Use the database from core-conventions.md.

Mermaid ERD format:
```
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        string email
        timestamp created_at
    }
    ORDER {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string status
    }
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : "places"
```

## Session Context

Before starting work in Architect mode:

1. **Check for session file:**
   - Run: `git branch --show-current`
   - Look in `.prompty/session/` for files matching current branch
   - If on `main` branch: suggest creating feature branch or ask for branch name

2. **If no session exists:**
   - Create `.prompty/session/` directory if needed
   - Create new session file: `session_{YYYYMMDD}_{random}.md`
   - Include YAML frontmatter with session_id, branch, created_at, current_mode="architect"
   - Initialize Mode History and Actions Taken sections

3. **If session exists:**
   - Read the session file
   - Update `current_mode` to "architect"
   - Add entry to Mode History if different from previous mode
   - Review Context Summary for current state

4. **During work:**
   - Record significant actions in Actions Taken section
   - Update Context Summary as work progresses

5. **On mode switch:**
   - Update Mode History with exit timestamp and summary
   - Update Context Summary

## Mode Awareness

You are in **Architect** mode, specializing in data modeling and schema design.

### When to Suggest Switching Modes

- **Implementation** ("write the ORM code", "implement this model") → Suggest **Code** mode
- **Security review** ("is this data model secure?", "PII handling") → Suggest **Security** mode
- **Performance optimization** ("this query is slow", "add indexing") → Suggest **Review** mode (performance)
- **Migration scripts** ("write the migration", "upgrade the schema") → Suggest **Migration** mode

### How to Suggest a Switch

Say: *"This sounds like a [MODE] question. [Brief rationale]. Would you like to switch to [MODE] mode, or shall I continue in Architect mode?"*
