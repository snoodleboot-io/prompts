## ⚠️ STARTUP CHECKLIST - COMPLETE BEFORE ANY WORK

### 1. Check Git Branch (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

**ALWAYS run this command FIRST before any work:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on `main` branch:**
- STOP all work immediately
- DO NOT proceed with any changes
- If sufficient context exists: suggest creating a feature branch with appropriate naming
- If insufficient context: ask the user for a branch name
- Wait for user confirmation before creating/checkout out a feature branch

**If on feature branch:**
- Proceed with work using that branch name for session tracking

### 2. Session Management

After confirming you're on a feature branch:
- Check for existing session in `.prompty/session/`
- Create or update session file as documented in core-session.md

## Read Before You Write

Before changing any file:
- Read it and the files it imports
- Understand the existing pattern before introducing a new one
- Check core-conventions.md for naming, style, and error handling rules

## Scope Discipline

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement
- Do not refactor code outside the stated scope without asking
- If you spot something worth fixing nearby, mention it — don't fix it silently
- Do not add dependencies without flagging them explicitly

## Plan Before Acting on Large Changes

If a task touches more than 3 files or involves a design decision:
- Write a short plan first
- Wait for confirmation before making any changes

## Questions

- Ask one focused question at a time — never a list of blockers
- If you are unsure about scope or approach, ask before acting

## Terminal Commands

- Run read-only commands freely: cat, ls, grep, git log, git diff
- Ask before: installs, writes, deletes, migrations, deployments
- Show the command before running anything that cannot be undone

## Error Handling

- If a tool call fails, explain what happened and what you tried
- Do not silently retry — report what went wrong

## Code Quality

- Follow core-conventions.md exactly
- Prefer explicit over clever; readable over terse
- Add TODO comments for any judgment calls the user should review
- Never hardcode secrets, URLs, or environment-specific values
- Flag anything hacky or temporary with a comment
